description: making a new blog with astro and the nth frontend framework this year.
---

## Ok this is crazy to make your own blog with a new framework but I was compelled to take astro.build for a spin.

### Tools used to make this blog:
- Astro
- Azure Static Web Apps
- Tailwind

Right now this is sprint 1 and there are a bunch of cosmetic changes I would like to make but for now this is a working blog in the spirit of agile and updates can happen in my favourite place production!

### Things I missed as in I missed in the docs on how to do it or they are still to come to astro:
1. How to import a typescript interface from another astro file
2. Logic like onClick for the previous and next buttons but hey its HTML and can explore adding react later
3. Spell checker which I would get from an online blog engine
4. 

### What I liked
1. So easy to use tailwind and postcss and control of HTML
2. Tiny output at 30kb
3. Markdown out of the box so simple
4. Future ability to extend with other frameworks
5. No need for any npm plugins to do routing, tailwind and markdown
