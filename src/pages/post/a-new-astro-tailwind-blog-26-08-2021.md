description: making a new blog with astro and the nth frontend framework this year.
---

## Ok this is crazy to make your own blog with a new framework but I was compelled to take astro.build for a spin.

### Tools used to make this blog:
- Astro
- Azure Static Web Apps
- Tailwind

Right now this is sprint 1 and there are a bunch of cosmetic changes I would like to make but for now this is a working blog in the spirit of agile and updates can happen in my favourite place production!

### Things I missed as in I missed in the docs on how to do it or they are still to come to astro:
1. Typescript in the astro files for interfaces
2. Logic like onClick for the previous and next buttons but hey its HTML and can explore adding react later
3. Images
